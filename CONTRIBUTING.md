# Contribute to ansible-styleguide

We'd love your contributions to this guide! A few things will help us ensure quality:

## Provide a 'Why?'

Every entry in the guide includes a 'Why?' section. 

Why is that?  Our favorite guides do this, and at WhiteCloud we find discussion of any practice is always more pointed when objective's clearly stated.

So, we ask you provide a 'Why?' in your PR or Issue.

A 'Why?' could be:

- A tip about a future Ansible improvement that makes the practice relevant or required.
- A story about mistake your team dealt with when practice wasn't followed.
- A story about something cool that happened when the practice was followed.
- Consistancy with another style

"So everyone does it the same way" is a valid "Why?", and better than nothing, but these are hard to discuss!

## Provide good/bad code examples

Code examples clearly showing correct practice and incorrect practice make the guide easier to read. Code examples also act as a test for the wording of the practice.
